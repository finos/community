# Graduation
Virtually all FINOS hosted projects are expected to strive towards, and ultimately attain, [Graduated status](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/graduated) and the related badge. A Graduated badge indicates to potential consumers that the project has reached a level of maturity, both functional and non-functional, that it is suitable for production use.

The [Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee) approves lifecycle transitions following objective criteria detailed in the below checklist. More information in the [FINOS Governance](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/#project-lifecycle).

### What does graduation mean for the consumer? 
:heavy_check_mark: The Project is high quality, mature from a codebase and community dynamics perspective. 

:dart: The Project produces valuable releases to solve a useful business problem for our Community.

### What does graduation mean for the project team?
:star: Glory in the Community 

:eyes: :loudspeaker: Increased visibility and positioning in FINOS web resources, marketing and Community building efforts like meetups, blog posts, etc.

| **Progress** | Project has progressed against its public roadmap during incubation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |
| **Versioning** | Project software is production grade and ready for large scale consumption. 1.0.0 version was released and announced it to the announce@ mailing list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |
| **Roadmap** | Projects share and work to a public roadmap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |  |
| **FINOS Support** | Project Team is largely self-sufficient, requiring minimal operational support from FINOS to govern and maintain the project. FINOS support switches to strategic growth of the Project in the Community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  |
|  | **GROWTH & ADOPTION**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |       |
| **Usefulness** | The Project demonstrably solves a real life use case in the Community. Evidence of adoption beyond the contributing individuals or firms (e.g., in the form of download statistics, listing known deployments or implementations, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |  |
| **Status Badging** | Project Team commits to adopt the FINOS Graduated badge in the README.md once the FINOS team approves activation, in order to properly signal  the new Project Lifecycle status to adopters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |  |
|  | **HYGIENE & OPERATIONS**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       |

| **Community Inquiries** | Community inquiries on the project channels (mailing lists, issues and pull requests, etc) are generally promptly answered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |   |
| **Meeting Hygiene** | If the project meets regularly on-line, the Project Team has demonstrated a track record of publishing and distributing agenda no less than 24 hours before the meeting, and publishes meeting minutes after calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |
| **Transparency** | Project Team has adopted a transparent governance model(*) consistent with FINOS Community governance. Work for new contributors is organized into issues within a public issue tracking system, as appropriate, tagged as "Good First Issues"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |

_(*) transparent governance model is when a project’s discussions, minutes, deliberations, project plans, issue tracking plans for new features, and other artefacts are open, public, and easily accessible in the FINOS Project Infrastructure or FINOS sanctioned external system._
