# Socialisation 
- [ ] Write and send contribution proposal announcement (optional - see below)
- [ ] Lead maintainer to send out announcement to community@finos.org using this template:
    
    ```
    Dear FINOS Community, 
    
    We would like to propose a new FINOS project. Please review the proposal details at (_TODO: add link to the GitHub issue proposal_).
    
    If you're interested in participating, please :+1: the GitHub issue proposal and drop a comment with your name, org and email

   Thanks a lot,
   ```     

# 2. Approval

The [FINOS Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee) (TOC) is responsible for approving FINOS project contributions; feel free to check their [contribution principles](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee/blob/master/contribution-principles.md).

If needed, the TOC will request a follow up either via GitHub Issue comments or by inviting project leads to one of their recurrent meetings.

Tasks (for FINOS Infra/TOC)
- [ ] Prioritise this issue on the [TOC Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/39)
- [ ] Assign this issue to @eddie-knight
- [ ] Add the `ready-for-toc` label
- [ ] TOC to invite contributors to present their project
- [ ] FINOS TOC approves/rejects the contribution

## TOC Findings / Report
*TOC to enter findings summary here.*

# 3. Preparing For Onboarding

Before the FINOS team can onboard your project, there are a few housekeeping items that need to be taken care of.  These must be completed by the contributor, with help if required from the FINOS Infra.   

## Kick-off meeting
 - [ ] Review the [project contribution agreement](https://community.finos.org/governance-docs/The.Linux.Foundation.--.Form.of.Trademark.Assignment.20221202.pdf) to allow FINOS to act on behalf of the contributor for accounts related to the project (e.g., GitHub, domain names, social media) and to optionally manage trademark assignment
- [ ] Review contribution checklist with FINOS staff
- [ ] Review FINOS project blueprint

## Logo / Trademarks
 - [ ] Request logo design from `help@finos.org` _(if needed)_

# 4.  FINOS Onboarding

This is performed by FINOS Infra once the three previous stages are complete, with support from the contributor and the FINOS Infra team.

## Code transfer preparation
- [ ] Ensure [finos-admin](http://github.com/finos-admin) is Admin of the GitHub repository to transfer

## Code Transfer Meeting
- [ ] Transfer all code assets as GitHub repositories under github.com/finos
- [ ] Rename main branch to `main` (instead of `master`)
- [ ] Enable EasyCLA
- [ ] Check that CVE (and preferably static code analysis, if applicable) scanning is in place
- [ ] Enable [branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) (`Require a pull request before merging`)
- [ ] Enable automated dependency update, using [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/)
- [ ] (best effort) Update release coordinates and code namespace to include `finos`

# 5. Announcement 
- [ ] Lead maintainer works with FINOS marketing to send out announcement to announce@finos.org , checkout announcement template at the [Contribution page](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution#step-5-contribution-announcements)
