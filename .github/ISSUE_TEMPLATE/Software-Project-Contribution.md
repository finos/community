# Onboarding Process

Completing an onboarding of a project into FINOS requires following these 5 main steps:  

1.  [**Describing the Contribution**](#1-describing-the-contribution) _led by contributor_
2.  [**Approval**](#2-approval) _led by FINOS TOC_
3.  [**Preparing for Onboarding**](#3-preparing-for-onboarding) _led by contributor_
4.  [**Onboarding**](#4--finos-onboarding) _completed by FINOS Infra_
5.  [**Announcement**](#4--finos-onboarding) _led by FINOS Marketing_

## Understanding FINOS Onboarding Requirements

As a project onboarding into FINOS, you will need to familiarize yourself and your contributor team with the following materials:

 - [FINOS overview](https://www.finos.org/hubfs/An%20Introduction%20to%20FINOS.pdf) (if necessary)
 - [FINOS Maintainers cheatsheet](https://community.finos.org/docs/finos-maintainers-cheatsheet/)
 - [FINOS Project/Standards Governance](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance)

## Record The Contribution (FINOS Infra)
- [ ] (optional) Identify and Assign FINOS Strategic Advisor
- [ ] Submit contribution to LF by opening a ticket via https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/browse/SS and marking contribution as "Exploratory"; attach a summary of the **Business Problem** and **Proposed Solution** (above) of the project.

# 2. Approval

The [FINOS Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee) (TOC) is responsible for approving FINOS project contributions; feel free to check their [contribution principles](https://github.com/finos/technical-oversight-committee/blob/master/contribution-principles.md).

If needed, the TOC will request a follow up either via GitHub Issue comments or by inviting project leads to one of their recurrent meetings.

Tasks (for FINOS Infra/TOC)
- [ ] Prioritise this issue on the [TOC Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/39)
- [ ] Assign this issue to @colineberhardt
- [ ] Add the `ready-for-tsc` label
- [ ] TOC to invite contributors to present their project
- [ ] FINOS TOC approves/rejects the contribution
- [ ] Ask @jgavronsky to mark contribution as "Engaged" within LF systems
- [ ] (optional) If additional socialization is required, the Executive Director may bring projects to the FINOS Governing Board
- [ ] Update the contribution status to "Engaged" by sending another email to **LF Legal Representative** with the name of the project and its new status.

## TOC Findings / Report
*TOC to enter findings summary here.*

# 3. Preparing For Onboarding

## Proposal (Lead Maintainer)
- [ ] Lead maintainer to send out announcement to community@finos.org using this template:
    
    ```
