# Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS)
A directed fund of the Linux Foundation
# Charter

Effective June 30, 2020

**1) Mission and Scope of the Fintech Open Source Foundation.**

a) The purpose of the Fintech Open Source FINOS Foundation (“FINOS”, or, alternatively,
the “Directed Fund”) is to raise, budget and spend funds in support of various open
source and/or open standards projects, including infrastructure and support initiatives
related thereto (each such project, a “Technical Project”). The Directed Fund intends to:
(a) promote innovation and interoperability in financial technology through industry-wide
collaboration on open source software and open standards; (b) foster a vibrant technical
community comprising financial technology consumers, service and solution providers,
and other constituents; and (c) provide a trusted, neutral forum for community
collaboration by offering an efficient, compliant open source collaboration infrastructure
and transparent, community-driven technical governance. The governance of each
Technical Project is as set forth in the applicable charter for each Technical Project.

b) The Directed Fund supports the Technical Projects. The Directed Fund operates under the
guidance of the Governing Board of the Directed Fund (the “Governing Board”) and The
Linux Foundation (the “LF”) as may be consistent with The Linux Foundation’s tax-
exempt status.

c) The Governing Board manages the Directed Fund. The Directed Fund will also have a
Budget Committee, Membership & Governance Committee, and other working groups,
councils, committees and similar bodies (collectively, “Committees”) that may be
established by the Governing Board. These committees report to the Governing Board.

**2) Membership.**

a) The Directed Fund will be composed of Platinum, Gold, Silver and Associate Members
(each, a “Member” and, collectively, the “Members”) in Good Standing. All Members
must be current corporate members of the LF (at any level) to participate in the Directed
Fund as a member. All participants in the Directed Fund, enjoy the privileges and
undertake the obligations described in this Charter, as from time to time amended by the
Governing Board with the approval of the LF. During the term of their membership, all
members will comply with all such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the
Directed Fund may adopt with notice to members.

b) There will be a maximum of 19 initial representatives on the Governing Board (the

Representative”) to the Governing Board. Initially there will be 10 Platinum
Representatives. The number of Platinum Members will not exceed the Governing Board
Cap less seven. Each Platinum Representative must be employed by a Platinum Member.

d) Gold Members, acting as a class, will be entitled to annually elect up to five
representatives to the Governing Board (each, a “Gold Representative”), as follows: the

Representative must be employed by a Gold Member.

e) Silver Members, acting as a class, will be entitled to annually elect one representative to
the Governing Board (the “Silver Representative”). The Silver Representative must be
employed by a Silver Member.
