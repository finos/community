# Foundation Governance

## Membership

FINOS is a membership organization within the [Linux Foundation](http://linuxfoundation.org/). We have three tiers of corporate membership (Platinum, Gold, and Silver), each with different rights and obligations under the Foundation's [Charter](Charter.pdf). For more information on the benefits of membership, please see our [Member Benefits Guide](https://www.finos.org/hubfs/FINOS/assets/2020%20-%20FINOS%20Member%20Benefits%20Guide.pdf).

Individuals who have made significant contributions to FINOS projects can join our [Individual Supporter program](Individual-Supporter-Program.md) to be recognized for their contributions and receive certain members-only benefits.

**NOTE**: Membership is NOT required to contribute to existing FINOS projects but contributors will need to comply with the [FINOS contribution compliance requirements](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530375/Contribution+Compliance+Requirements).

## Governing Board

The Foundation is overseen by a [Governing Board](https://finos.org/board-of-directors/) composed of member representative appointed (and elected) by our members and led by FINOS Executive Director. The Foundation's day-to-day operations are run by the [FINOS team](finos.org/team).

## Policies

The following policies apply to all FINOS members and activities:

* The [Charter](Charter.pdf) is the Foundation's constitution. It sets out our mission, members' rights and responsibilities, the authority and procedures of our Governing Board and its committees, and other Foundation policies.

* The [Participation Agreement](Participation-Agreement.pdf) is the agreement that all of our members sign to join FINOS. It sets membership fees and terms and binds members to the terms of the [Charter](Charter.pdf). FINOS members must also be members of the Linux Foundation (at any level) and remain in compliance with LF's [Good Standing Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/good-standing-policy). There is no requirement for membership to participate in the FINOS Community, but only members can propose new projects.

* The [Community Code of Conduct](Code-of-Conduct.md) is the set of principles that participants in the Foundation's collaborative work are expected to abide by to maintain a healthy and inclusive community.

* The [IP Policy](IP-Policy.pdf) contains rules related to the intellectual property of FINOS, our members, and contributors. It includes policies for the licensing of contributions to FINOS projects, licensing of FINOS projects to third parties, and licensing of contributions to FINOS technical standards. The policy also requires all contributors to FINOS projects to sign either a [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](CCLA.pdf) (for corporate/institutional contributors) and [Individual Contributor License Agreement](ICLA.pdf) (for individual contributors whose contributions are not owned by their employer).

* The [Trademark Guidelines](Trademark-Guidelines.pdf) list the Foundation's trademarks and set out our policies for appropriate use of FINOS project marks.

* The Linux Foundation [Antitrust Policy](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy) applies to all FINOS collaborative projects and prohibits all potentially anticompetive conduct.

# Community Governance

FINOS is home to two kinds of [collaborative projects](finos.github.io): open source software projects and open standards projects. The majority of FINOS projects are open source software projects. FINOS projects are self-governing and may determine their own governance rules consistent with FINOS policies and the [open source definition](https://opensource.org/docs/osd), but FINOS provides default governance templates for both to provide projects with a starting point. 

FINOS also hosts Special Interest Groups (SIGs), forums where community members sharing an interest in a certain topic discuss ideas, compare experiences, and consider common solutions (which may or may not take the form of new open source software or standards projects). 

## Open Source Software Projects

FINOS is home to dozens of open source projects. Any FINOS member (and only FINOS members) may propose a new project or sponsor a project from an outside contributor. Project proposals are reviewed and approved by the FINOS team in consultation with the Governing Board. Please refer to the [contribution process](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/83034172/Contribute) if you'd like to propose a new project. 

### Open Source Software Projects Governance

The [default governance policy](Software-Projects/CONTRIBUTING.template.md) for FINOS open source software projects follows a governance-by-contribution model. Project maintainers have the last word on technical matters, reaching decisions by consensus if possible and by vote if necessary. Anyone who has made a substantial contribution (of any kind) to the project may be nominated to become a maintainer.

## Open Standards Projects

Information about FINOS open standards project governance can be found in the [Standards-Projects folder](Standards-Projects). Standards projects are governed by detailed IP rules set out in the [FINOS IP Policy](IP-Policy.pdf). All participants in standards projects are bound by these rules, even if their only contribution is participation in project meetings. This is to ensure that any specification or other materials produced by a standards project may be licensed freely to all.

### Open Standards Projects Governance

The default governance policy for FINOS standards projects can be found [here](Standards-Projects/CONTRIBUTING.standards.md).

## Project Lifecycle

Software projects follow the [Project Lifecycle](Software-Projects/Project-Lifecycle.md), a useful tool for consumers and contributors to quickly evaluate maturity, activity, and quality. Projects are contributed the "Incubating" state and graduate to "Active" and finally may move to the "Archived" state (from either Incubating or Active) if they are no longer actively developed. 

The FINOS team approves lifecycle transitions following objective criteria detailed for [Incubating](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530363/Incubating#Incubating-IncubatingLifecycleChecklist) and [Active](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530376/Activation#Activation-ActivationLifecycleChecklist) projects. 

Some projects may optionally start in a time-bound pre-incubation stage called *Formation*, which is typically restricted to FINOS Members or at the discretion of the project lead.

## Project Metrics 
Live metrics of Project activity and contributions across all FINOS collaboration systems are publicly available in [FINOS Project Activity Dashboard](metrics.finos.org).

## Project Quarterly Reporting 

Every quarter, data about the health, activity, and progress of projects is reported to the Governing Board. Reports are largely generated automatically out of the [FINOS Project Activity Dashboard](metrics.finos.org) and provided to project teams for review and revision before being passed along to the board. The Governing Board and FINOS team use these reports to determine which projects need additional attention, which should be considered for archiving, etc.

### Quarterly Focus projects
Additionally, every quarter the Governing Board identifies 5 or 6 "focus projects" to receive particular attention from the FINOS team during the following quarter, with the goal of support growth and progression through the Project Lifecycle. Focus projects should be prepared to provide more detailed progressreports to the Board at the next Board meeting. For a list of current focus projects, see [Quarterly Focus Projects](../focus-projects/README.md).
