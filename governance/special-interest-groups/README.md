# Special Interest Groups
Special Interest Groups provide a venue to discuss and compare notes on a common topic of interest. SIGs governance is documented [here](https://github.com/finos/community/tree/master/governance#special-interest-groups). 

Here's a list of special interest groups (SIGs) currently active in FINOS:

| Name  | Charter | Chair | URL  | Approved on  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  Innersource | Create a safe space to identify and share challenges and solutions that accelerate Financial Services organizations’ efforts to implement InnerSource | Chair: Daniela Zheleva, DB Co-chair: Arthur Maltson / Roderick Randolph, Capital One  |  https://github.com/finos/InnerSource/  | January 20st 2021 - [See Proposal](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/special-interest-groups/202101%20-%20InnerSource%20SIG%20Proposal%20-%20APPROVED.pdf) |
|  Regulation Innovation | The Regulation Innovation SIG will be a community of people interested in creating open source solutions for regulatory and compliance issues. Creating open source solutions to regulatory compliance is particularly important because the market is currently using custom-built, one-off solutions, that are expensive, inefficient, and costly to manage and update over time.  | Ian Hollowbread (ING), David Ehrich (AIR)  |  https://github.com/finos/open-regtech  | October 21st 2020 |
|  DevOps Mutualization | Identify and share homegrown solutions that enable regulated enterprises to manage the engineering toolchain, from ‘admin proxies’ to ‘glue to connect multiple tools together’, whilst finding opportunities to collaborate with the FINOS Community and possibly set standards on how these challenges should be addressed. | Amol Shukla (Morgan Stanley), Anders Wallgren (CloudBees) | https://github.com/finos-labs/devops-mutualization  | October 21st 2020 |
|  Diversity & Inclusion| To demonstrably improve diversity of FINOS through increased participation of underrepresented people on the Board, among FINOS team members, and the FINOS community | Alejandra Villagra (Citi) | On October 21st 2020, the Board ratified this group operating as a Board committee vs a SIG. Further updates will be puslished at a later stage. | July 15th 2020 |
    

## Want to propose a new SIG?

If you are FINOS member and you'd like to propose a new SIG for Board approval, [just raise an issue](https://github.com/finos/community/issues/new?assignees=aitana16%2C+maoo&labels=contribution&template=Special-Interest-Group-Contribution.md&title=Special+Interest+Group+Contribution+and+Onboarding) 
and the FINOS team will work with you to bring the proposal to the Board if relevant.

## Other potential SIGs

The FINOS Governing could be looking at converting into SIGs existing long running initiatives like:

- [Open Source Readiness Project](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OSR/pages/154435612/Open+Source+Readiness+Working+Group)
- [Open Developer Platform Project](https://github.com/finos/open-developer-platform/)
