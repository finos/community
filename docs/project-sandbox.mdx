The FINOS Project Sandbox allows [FINOS open source projects](https://landscape.finos.org) to host a public runtime environment to serve different purposes, like enabling easy evaluation, public collaboration or delivering real life demo environments. The FINOS technology team provides infrastructure and operational support to project maintainers, enabling them to focus on development rather than operations.
