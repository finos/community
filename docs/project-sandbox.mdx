title: FINOS Project Sandbox
---

The FINOS Project Sandbox allows [FINOS open source projects](https://landscape.finos.org) to host a public runtime environment to serve different purposes, like enabling easy evaluation, public collaboration or delivering real life demo environments. The FINOS technology team provides infrastructure and operational support to project maintainers, enabling them to focus on development rather than operations.

For the Legend Shared instance - our first and most used project sandbox - we have documented the setup on [community.finos.org/docs/platforms/legend-studio-shared](https://community.finos.org/docs/platforms/legend-studio-shared/).
