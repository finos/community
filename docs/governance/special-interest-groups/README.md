title: Special Interest Groups
---

Special Interest Groups provide a venue to discuss and compare notes on a common topic of interest. SIGs governance is documented [here](/docs/governance#special-interest-groups). 

Here's a list of special interest groups (SIGs) currently active in FINOS:

| Name  | Charter | Chair | Approved on |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Open Source Readiness](https://github.com/finos/open-source-readiness) | Be a trusted venue for our Members and Community in their open source journey and enable them to achieve the highest state of open source maturity.| Cara Delia (Red Hat) <br/> Brittany Istenes (Fannie Mae) <br/> Thomas Cooper (RBC) <br/> Peter Smulovics (Morgan Stanley) | April 21st 2021 |
| [Financial Objects](https://github.com/finos/finos-fo/) | Provide a neutral forum for individuals across the financial services industry to collectively identify the need for new, open, financial objects standards as well as modifications to  existing ones.

| [Regulation Innovation](https://github.com/finos/open-regtech) | The Regulation Innovation SIG will be a community of people interested in creating open source solutions for regulatory and compliance issues.

| [DevOps Mutualization](https://github.com/finos-labs/devops-mutualization) | Identify and share homegrown solutions that enable regulated enterprises to manage the engineering toolchain, from ‘admin proxies’ to ‘glue to connect multiple tools together’, whilst finding opportunities to collaborate with the FINOS Community and possibly set standards on how these challenges should be addressed. | Amol Shukla (Morgan Stanley) <br/> Robb Keayes (Nomura) | October 21st 2020 |
| [Diversity, Equity and Inclusion](https://github.com/finos/DEI-SIG) | To demonstrably improve diversity of FINOS through increased participation of underrepresented people on the Board, among FINOS team members, and the FINOS community | Melinda Aulie (Cosaic) | In January 2022, the Board ratified this group operating as a SIG, after one year running as a Board committeee | January 2022 |
| [Zenith](https://github.com/finos/zenith) | To explore and promote the adoption of new and innovative technologies in the financial services industry. | Peter Smulovics (Morgan Stanley) <br/>Keith O'Donell (Feynic) <br/>Patrick Downing (Morgan Stanley) | April 26th 2023 |
