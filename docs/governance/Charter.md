A directed fund of the Linux Foundation

Effective July 19, 2023

**1) Mission and Scope of the Fintech Open Source Foundation.**

a) The purpose of the Fintech Open Source FINOS Foundation (“FINOS”, or, alternatively,
the “Directed Fund”) is to raise, budget and spend funds in support of various open
source and/or open standards projects, including infrastructure and support initiatives
related thereto (each such project, a “Technical Project”). The Directed Fund intends to:
(a) promote innovation and interoperability in financial technology through industry-wide
collaboration on open source software and open standards; (b) foster a vibrant technical
community comprising financial technology consumers, service and solution providers,
and other constituents; and (c) provide a trusted, neutral forum for community
collaboration by offering an efficient, compliant open source collaboration infrastructure
and transparent, community-driven technical governance. The governance of each
Technical Project is as set forth in the applicable charter for each Technical Project.

b) The Directed Fund supports the Technical Projects. The Directed Fund operates under the
guidance of the Governing Board of the Directed Fund (the “Governing Board”) and The
Linux Foundation (the “LF”) as may be consistent with The Linux Foundation’s
tax-exempt status.

c) The Governing Board manages the Directed Fund. The Directed Fund will also have a
Budget Committee, Technical Oversight Committee (“TOC”), Membership &
Governance Committee, and other working groups, councils, committees and similar
bodies (collectively, “Committees”) that may be established by the Governing Board.
These committees report to the Governing Board.

**2) Membership.**

a) The Directed Fund will be composed of Platinum, Gold, Silver and Associate Members
(each, a “Member” and, collectively, the “Members”) in Good Standing. All Members
must be current corporate members of the LF (at any level) to participate in the Directed
Fund as a member. All participants in the Directed Fund, enjoy the privileges and
undertake the obligations described in this Charter, as from time to time amended by the

members will comply with all such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the
Directed Fund may adopt with notice to members.
