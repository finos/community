title: The Sandbox stage
---

Experimental or concept Projects may be created within the finos-labs organsiation, regardless of their size or level of maturity.  As projects become more mature they may be become Incubated within the FINOS organisation by [requesting onboarding](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/software-projects/contribution/#contribution-of-an-existing-code-base-into-finos-as-a-new-project).

## Objectives

The objectives of the sandbox finos-labs stage is to allow the project team to form in the open, and start to work through their concepts collaboratively within the FINOS umbrella.     

## Lifecycle of a finos-labs project

### Starting

Anything github repo can be started by a project or SIG lead.

### Maintaining

Normal restrictions on who can maintain or contribute to a labs repo once assigned by lead.
* If a Labs repo has no GitHub activity for 1 year, it qualifies for archival
* If a Labs repo has active users, it should receive TOC oversight or prepare to exit labs
* If a Labs repo is marketed beyond FINOS contributors through promo materials, conference talks, etc., then it must receive TOC oversight. This process is TBD

### Migration out of Labs

1. Apply to become a project in FINOS proper
2. Recommend for other LF foundation
3. Archive

## Requirements

1. SIG / TOC Sponsor
TODO - what is appropriate here?
