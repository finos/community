title: The Active stage
---

Projects that have been approved for activation transition to the Active state, a formal recognition that **the software is now suitable for production use**.

Virtually all Foundation-hosted projects are expected to strive towards, and ultimately attain, Active status. This indicates to potential consumers that the project has reached a level of maturity, both functional and non-functional, that it is suitable for production use.

## Objectives

The first priority of a newly Active project is to deploy a `v1.0.0` or higher production-grade version.
The Foundation expects this to occur soon after activation, ideally within one month.

Once a `v1.0.0` is released, the objectives of the Active lifecycle state primarily involve the project team developing and executing on an ongoing roadmap of features and bug fixes, informed by feedback from the project's user base.

## Releases

An Active project can use any version number it wishes, although it is expected that virtually all releases from a released project will be `≥ v1.0.0`. Ecosystem-specific suffixes may also be used for pre-releases (e.g. `-SNAPSHOT` in the Java ecosystem, or `-alpha`, `-beta`, etc. in the .NET ecosystem).

All Active project starting from `v1.0.0` upward must adhere to the version numbering rules defined by semantic versioning, specifically:

- Increment `MAJOR` version when an incompatible change is made
- Increment `MINOR` version when new functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner
- Increment `PATCH` version when bugs are fixed in a backwards-compatible manner

**NOTE!**
The Foundation strongly recommends the use of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) ("semver") throughout a project's lifecycle.

## Initiating Activation

In order for a project to become Active, it must be reviewed and the change formally approved by the Project Lead Maintainer; any project team may initiate this approval process at any time, which involves:

- Preparing an information packet demonstrating that they've met the requirements for activation (see below for details).
- Submitting the packet via the project's GitHub Issue.
- Have obtained and are demonstrating an [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org) as laid out below.

## Approval Process

Activation votes are performed by the Project Lead Maintainer, and only after any outstanding questions or clarifications are answered by the project team.

## Requirements

### Badge

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finos/contrib-toolbox/master/images/badge-active.png" width="150"/>

Foundation-hosted projects are expected to provide a clear indication to visitors that they are active. To this end, the Foundation provides a badge that should be displayed at the top of the project's root-level `README.md` file, using the following Markdown:

```
[![FINOS - Active](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/finos/contrib-toolbox@master/images/badge-active.svg)](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/stages/active)
```

## Activation Lifecycle Checklist

The FINOS team approves lifecycle transitions following objective criteria detailed in the below checklist. More information in the [FINOS Governance](https://github.com/finos/community/tree/master/governance#project-lifecycle).

### What does activation mean for the consumer?

:heavy_check_mark: The Project is high quality, mature from a codebase and community dynamics perspective.

:dart: The Project produces valuable releases to solve a useful business problem for our Community.

### What does activation mean for the project team?

:star: Glory in the Community

:eyes: :loudspeaker: Increased visibility and positioning in FINOS web resources, marketing and Community building efforts like meetups, blog posts, etc.

## Obtaining the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge

In order to achieve an Active status, FINOS requires that every project also meets the [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge](OpenSSF-Criteria-Passing.md) `pass` criteria prior to requesting activation.

The `pass` criteria for FINOS Active status can be found in the [OpenSSF Best Practices Badge](OpenSSF-Criteria-Passing.md) page of this repository.

| **Meeting Hygiene**     | If the project meets regularly on-line, the Project Team has demonstrated a track record of publishing and distributing agenda no less than 24 hours before the meeting, and publishes meeting minutes after calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Transparency**        | Project Team has adopted a transparent governance model(\*) consistent with FINOS Community governance. Work for new contributors is organized into issues within a public issue tracking system, as appropriate, tagged as "Good First Issues"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

_(\*) transparent governance model is when a project’s discussions, minutes, deliberations, project plans, issue tracking plans for new features, and other artefacts are open, public, and easily accessible in the FINOS Project Infrastructure or FINOS sanctioned external system._

## Notes for Evaluators

If you're evaluating Foundation-hosted open source projects and see the released badge shown above, here are some of the things you should expect should you choose to download and use the software.

- The software is functional, though perhaps minimally viable.
- The software has high quality - it has met or exceeded all of the Foundation's security and compliance requirements, and has been well tested.
- The installation & upgrade experiences should be relatively smooth - binaries will be available at a minimum, and more advanced deployment options (installers, containers, VM images, automated upgrade scripts etc.) may also be available.
- The project is well documented.
- The project is supported by an engaged project team. While there may not be a formal SLA (depending on the availability of commercial support for the project), bugs and enhancement requests will be triaged and addressed by the team.
- Backwards compatibility is a priority, and [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) (or similar) is used to clearly communicate breaking changes.
