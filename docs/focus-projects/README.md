title: What is a Quarterly Focus Project?
---

Every quarter the Board evaluates and selects 5/6 focus projects that are in formation, incubation or active stage. Focus projects get special attention from the FINOS team, according to the [FINOS Project Support Guidelines](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/1511161857/Project+Support+Guidelines), during a 3 months period in order to achieve goals most often related to growing maturity, adoption and contribution, often resulting in the project evolve to the next stage in the [Project Lifecycle](/docs/governance/project-lifecycle).

## Current focus projects

Given the breadth and depth of activity in the FINOS community, starting Q2 2021 the Governing Board has decided to pause the concept of Focus Projects and provide a broader support to all projecs in FINOS.
