# Welcome
Welcome to the FINOS Maintainers Cheatsheet, the guide for new and experienced [FINOS Maintainers](https://github.com/finos/software-project-blueprint/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#roles) on engaging with the [FINOS Community](https://www.finos.org/get-involved), [FINOS Team](https://www.finos.org/team) and [FINOS Governing Board](https://www.finos.org/governing-board) to drive project success.

## About FINOS
[FINOS](https://finos.org) is part of [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org) and has the mission to enable a global community to create open source solutions for financial services. The [FINOS Knowledge Base](https://www.finos.org/knowledge-base) contains helpful resources on FINOS, the FINOS community and FINOS projects. Learn more in the [FINOS Governance](/docs/governance) and email [help@finos.org](mailto:help@finos.org) with questions or suggestions.

## FINOS Projects and Special Interest Groups (SIGs)

FINOS [Open Source Software projects](/docs/governance/#open-source-software-projects), [Open Standards projects](/docs/governance/#open-standard-projects), and [Special Interest Groups (SIGs)](/docs/governance/#special-interest-groups) are at the very core of FINOS' mission to accelerate the use and development of open source software, standards, and practices to solve common challenges and drive innovation within the financial services industry. 

The open source software and standards projects hosted within FINOS cover a wide range of functions key to financial services including interoperability, cloud, infrastructure and data.

The [FINOS Landscape](https://landscape.finos.org) provides an overview of all FINOS projects and Special Interest Groups, and the [FINOS GitHub organization](https://github.com/finos) hosts the code of all FINOS projects.

# Maintainer Role
Each FINOS project and SIG has a community of [participants](https://github.com/finos/software-project-blueprint/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#roles), also referred to as "contributors", and [maintainers](https://github.com/finos/software-project-blueprint/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#roles). 

A **contributor** is anyone who submits a contribution to the project. Contributions include code & pull requests, issues, comments, documentation, media, or any combination of the above.

A **maintainer** is a contributor who, by virtue of their contribution history, has been given [write access](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#repository-roles-for-organizations) to project repositories and may approve and merge  contributions to the project.

It is possible, and advised, that projects have multiple maintainers, in which case maintainers will elect one or two **lead maintainers**. The lead maintainer is the project's interface with the FINOS Team and Governing Board. Lead maintainers are responsible for communicating with the FINOS Team, Governing Board and Community on behalf of the project. The lead maintainer(s) are also accountable for steering project direction and prioritisation with the rest of the project community. They are also accountable for the quality of deliverables produced by the project community.

FINOS Standards projects can also have [**editors**](https://github.com/finos/standards-project-blueprint/blob/master/governance-documents/5._Governance.md#1roles).

# Maintainer responsibilities and available resources

FINOS project maintainers are responsible for technical & subject matter oversight of the project, and for driving commmunity growth and engagement. FINOS supports project maintainers and their project communities through:
