## How can you become a FINOS Community leader?
As you start [consuming](https://community.finos.org/docs/journey/consume) and [contributing](https://community.finos.org/docs/journey/participate) to FINOS projects, there are multiple ways for you to become a leader in our community: 

- Become a [FINOS Project Maintainer](#leadership-through-maintainership)
- Your company can fund [FINOS through Membership](#leadership-through-membership)
- Provide [feedback and enhance our governance & documentation](https://github.com/finos/community/issues)Â 
- Organize or speak at an [FINOS Open Source in Finance Meetup](/docs/growing-your-project-community/meetups)
- Speak or sponsor our [Open Source in Finance Forum](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-finance-forum/)

## Leaderhip through maintainership
Open Source is the culture of the doers and everyone has an opportunity to become a FINOS contributor and then maintainer, through a meritocratic process of governance by contribution. As you [increasingly contribute to FINOS](https://community.finos.org/docs/journey/participate), we encourage to consider taking on more influence / responsibility by becoming a FINOS maintainer. 

If are already a [FINOS contributor or maintainer](https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/finos/active-contributor?time=%7B%22from%22:%22now-90d%22,%22type%22:%22datemath%22,%22to%22:%22now%22%7D), we deeply thank you for your support. It through leaders like you who drive FINOS' success.

### What's FINOS Project Maintainer?
Each FINOS software project has a community of [participants](https://github.com/finos/software-project-blueprint/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#roles), also referred to as "contributors", and [maintainers](https://github.com/finos/software-project-blueprint/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#roles).

Each FINOS standard projects has a community of [participants, editors and maintainers](https://github.com/finos/standards-project-blueprint/blob/master/governance-documents/5._Governance.md#1roles).

A **maintainer** is a contributor who, by virtue of their contribution history, has been given [write access](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization#repository-roles-for-organizations) to project repositories and may approve and merge contributions to the project.

### How do I become a maintainer?
There two ways an individual can become a FINOS Maintainer:
1. By being the proposed initial maintainer [of new project contribution accepted into FINOS](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/contribution#contribution-of-an-existing-code-base-into-finos-as-a-new-project) 
2. By being nominated by an existing project's maintainers, based on extensive contributions to the project. 

FINOS strong encourages projects to have multiple maintainers from multiple organizations: in fact having multiple maintainers is a pre-requisite for the [Graduation](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/maturity/graduated) project [lifecycle maturity level](https://community.finos.org/docs/governance/Software-Projects/project-lifecycle).

In the case of large maintainer teams, maintainers should consider electing one or two **lead maintainers**. The lead maintainer(s) are the project's interface with the FINOS Team and Governing Board and are responsible for communicating on behalf of the project. The lead maintainer(s) are also accountable for steering project direction and prioritisation with the rest of the project community, and to build consensus.

### How does FINOS support maintainers?
To support you in your leadership capacity, we've prepared a [FINOS Maintainers Cheatsheet](https://community.finos.org/docs/finos-maintainers-cheatsheet/) that is intended to be a one-stop reference for all of the responsibilities, governance activities, and support tools used by the Foundation. Our [Community Growth best practices](https://community.finos.org/docs/growing-your-project-community/finos-community-strategy/leveraging-finos-projects-sigs) are also a great resources to build a lively community.

And of course don't hesitate to [get in touch with Foundation staff](mailto:help@finos.org) if you need help in maintaining your project.
