### Project & SIG specific Lists
Most projects maintain mailing lists that anyone can post to. The mailing list reaches all participants in that project. They are a good venue for scope, functional, and technical questions about the project as well as expressing an interest in participating.

You can self subscribe to any public FINOS mailing list by sending an email to the list with a `+subscribe` added after the name of the list, like so fdc3+subscribe@finos.org. You can also email help@finos.org and request to be added directly.
